## Guessit
Guessing game for Reddit

I made this within like 4 class periods for my AP Comp Sci Priciples final.
It pulls the title, thumbnail, and some other info from top posts from the top 23 subreddits. You then have to guess which subreddit it's from.

The code is messy and inefficient, but I procrastinated on the project and just wanted something that worked. I'd like to migrate this all to Vue in the future.
